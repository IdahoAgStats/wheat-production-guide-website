    "text": "There are various University of Idaho bulletins associated with production of wheat in Idaho, and many were produced years ago by UI researchers who have long retired. The University researchers currently working in wheat production are located throughout the state, each with their own websites and research projects specific to their area of expertise.\nWith the many scattered resources and old bulletins that are hard to find and access, there was not one UI cereals or wheat website that could be used by producers to access the latest research results and production recommendations. At the request of the Idaho Wheat Commission, an accessible wheat publication coordinating information for producers in one location online and in a printable bulletin or production guide was needed to address this information gap."
